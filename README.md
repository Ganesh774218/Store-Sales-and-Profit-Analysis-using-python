# Store-Sales-and-Profit-Analysis-using-python
Store Sales & Profit Analysis —
⦁	This repository delivers a practical, Python-based toolkit for assessing a retail store’s financial and operational performance. By transforming transaction-level sales, cost, and product metadata into clear KPIs (revenue, gross profit, margin, SKU/store contribution, and period-over-period trends), the project uncovers underperforming products and locations, seasonal and weekday patterns, and high-impact opportunities for pricing, promotions, and inventory rebalancing.
⦁	The deliverables include reproducible notebooks for data ingestion and cleaning, exploratory visualizations, cohort and category segmentation, basic forecasting and anomaly detection, and a framework for converting insights into prioritised business actions—helping analysts and decision-makers drive revenue growth and margin improvement with data-backed recommendations.
⦁	The dataset has an order date column.The order date field is a rich source for feature engineering: extracting order month, year, day (and optionally week, weekday, quarter, or fiscal period) enables temporal aggregation and segmentation that are essential for robust sales and profit analysis. These derived time dimensions support trend and seasonality detection, period-over-period comparisons, cohort analyses, rolling-window metrics, and time-aware forecasting—helping to pinpoint peak demand windows, evaluate promotional impact, allocate inventory, and attribute profit performance to specific time intervals.


Project Overview:
This analysis explores sales and profitability trends across product categories, subcategories, and customer segments.
Using visual analytics and data aggregation, the goal is to understand how different business segments contribute to overall revenue and profit — ultimately identifying which areas drive growth and which require optimization.



Objectives:
⦁	Analyze monthly sales and profit trends to observe seasonality and performance patterns.
⦁	Compare sales and profit distribution across categories and their respective subcategories.
⦁	Examine customer segments to evaluate their contribution to total revenue and profitability.
⦁	Compute the Sales-to-Profit Ratio to assess efficiency and profitability across segments.



Key Insights:
⦁	Consumer Segment generates the highest total sales, but with the lowest profit margin — requiring approximately ₹8.66 in sales to earn ₹1 of profit.
⦁	The Corporate Segment demonstrates moderate profitability, maintaining a balance between revenue and cost efficiency (₹7.68 sales per ₹1 profit).
⦁	Home Office Segment is the most profitable, needing only ₹7.13 in sales to achieve ₹1 of profit — indicating superior cost and pricing efficiency.
⦁	Technology and Office Supplies categories tend to deliver higher profit margins compared to Furniture, which shows high revenue but lower profitability.



Conclusion:
The study highlights the importance of evaluating not just sales performance but also profitability efficiency.
While the Consumer segment drives the largest portion of revenue, the Home Office segment offers the best return per sale — making it strategically valuable for targeted marketing and expansion.
Continuous monitoring of category and segment profitability can help businesses:
⦁	Optimize pricing strategies
⦁	Streamline low-margin product lines
⦁	Focus on high-yield customer groups


Business Impact:
This kind of sales-profit analysis empowers organizations to make data-driven decisions, ensuring sustainable growth and improved profitability across multiple business dimensions.
